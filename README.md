# Applied-Machine-Learning-algorithms
Applied Machine learning algorithms using Python, pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn 

This repository contains the application of Applied Machine learning alogrithms like Knn, K-Means and LOGISTIC REGRESSION. 
I have used PYTHON Programming Language and Jupyter Notebook as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
